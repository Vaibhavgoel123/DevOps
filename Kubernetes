Kubernetes (often abbreviated as K8s) is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. 
It was originally developed by Google and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).

Features:
1. Load balancing
2. Scaling
3. Self healing
4. Cluster (Group of nodes) level formation

It never creates container but it manages the container.

Master node 
1. Minimum 1 and Maximum 3

Worker node
N number of nodes

Advantages
1. High availability
2. Centeralized management
3. Scalability
4. Project level isolation
5. User level role (RBAC --> Role based access control)
6. Quota allocation
7. Internal load balancing

Master node (Control Pane):
API Server --> Establishes connection between the components.(kube-apiserver)
etcd --> It store key value pair in yaml format. 
controller --> It works with api server and recursively communicates with etcd. It manages actual value (current value) and desired value.
scheduler --> It finds the best fit node bases on resources and other factors.

Worker node:
Kubelet --> It creates pod and connects with controller it by the api server. It takes the set of PodSpecs and ckeck on them.
CRI (container runtime interface) --> It creates container.
Network Proxy(kube proxy) --> It creates and manage networking between pods.

These components are also available in master node.
